            <h1>Student Conduct</h1>
            <p>Students at Oxford are subject to two separate (but complementary) sets of disciplinary regulations: the
                rules and by-laws of your college provided in your college handbook, or equivalent document, and the
                University's conduct regulations including the Code of Discipline.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="course-col align-box">
                <h3>General Conduct</h3>
                <p>Statute XI on University discipline contains a Code of Discipline applying to all University members
                    and to students who have a contract with the University who are not formally University members. It
                    sets out the actions and behaviours that are unacceptable in the University context.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="course-col align-box">
                <h3>Local Rules</h3>
                <p>Students using buildings, property or services are advised to familiarise themselves with any
                    published rules, for example as displayed on noticeboards in or at the entrance to buildings or
                    property or on the service’s website. Failing to abide by these rules may lead to a temporary or
                    permanent ban. An allegation of a breach of local rules may be referred to the Proctors for
                    investigation as a possible disciplinary offence under Statute XI.</p>


            </div>
            <div class="course-col align-box">
                <h3>Policies and Codes of Practice</h3>
                <p>No member of the University shall intentionally or recklessly commit a breach of any of the
                    regulations relating to the use of the libraries or the information and communications technology
                    facilities of the University. Note that any infringement of copyright through the University IT
                    network, including using peer-to-peer software and file-sharing to download and distribute
